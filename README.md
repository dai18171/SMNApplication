# SMNApplication
Project for Mobile Development Course.

Combines all three APIs of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
By using Graph API and Twitte4j the app is able to make posts and share stories simultaneously on these 3 apps.
It's also able to search for the most popular hashtags in Twitter or search for hashtags that include a certain word. 
Then by choosing one of them, it provides posts from Facebook and Instagram which use this hashtag.

**However, the project is not yet finished and can clearly be improved.
